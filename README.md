Ultra-fast Ray Tracing against Animated 3D Objects

Project Description
In modern game engines, even with state-of-the-art hardware support, real-time ray tracing is still considered slow, especially against animated 3D objects. In this project, you will explore a new ray tracing method that can be ultra-fast even with a low-end GPU without RTX support. Specifically, you will implement 1) dynamic projection of the surface of an object into a 3D binary array, known as an occupancy map, and 2) hierarchical ray marching that mimics line drawing on a screen, just in 3D instead. Time permitting, you may also explore hierarchical approaches that can further accelerate the ray tracing process, and may implement this method in Unreal Engine.
